# AI using a MINMAX algorithm

-   Works assuming the other player will play optimally

# Minimax Algorithm Explanation

The following image illustrates the logic behind the Minimax algorithm. The AI evaluates potential moves by simulating the game tree and predicting the best possible outcome, assuming both players play optimally. The goal of the AI is to maximize its score while minimizing the opponent's score. Each node in the tree represents a game state, and the AI chooses the move that leads to the most favorable outcome.
